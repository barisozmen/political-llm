This current django project is a boilerplate template, instead of being a standalone product. I want to make an AI-first Mobile-first Political God LLM out of this. This LLM will be for a network state to make laws of the new futuristic state. The users will give their values and principles as the system prompt, and then let the LLM to generate laws for the state.

Be very creative and design this as a new product. You can add any feature you want.

Users:
- can sign in via google social or magiclink (boilerplate already implemented most of this)
- can see their profile page

Subscription via Stripe:
- 10$ -> 1000 credits
- 50$ -> 5000 credits
- 100$ -> 10000 credits

Credits:
- Each law generation will cost 10 credits
- Each search will cost 1 credit
- Each law will be saved to the database, and can be used in the future


Instructions:
- Read whole the codebase of this boilerplate template, and understand well. You should re-use boilerplate template's codebase as much as possible.

Awesome! But there is a problem with URL logic here.

The home page is still tied to the boilerplate code. It should be tied to the main app of Political God LLM. Re-organize the URL sytem, so that user goes directly to the Political God LLM homepage when visiting the website. If necessary, create new templates/web pages
